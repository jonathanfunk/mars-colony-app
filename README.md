## Learning Experience
When I downloaded my first Angular 2 project, I was amazed by the amount of content that came with it. In this project, I created classes, components, services, and set up the register form which allows the users to input their name, age and occupation and come up with a creative encounter with an alien and post it for all to see. It took some getting used to connecting the classes, services and components together but once I did, I got more comfortable reading the docs which solved my problems.
